Qual Quant https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-017-0469-8<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its<br>beginnings, historical development, usefulness<br>and controversies in the social sciences<br>Piotr Tarka1<br>Published online: January The Author(s) This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com<br>Abstract This paper is a tribute to researchers who have significantly contributed to<br>improving and advancing structural equation modeling (SEM). It is, therefore, a brief<br>overview of SEM and presents its beginnings, historical development, its usefulness in the<br>social sciences and the statistical and philosophical (theoretical) controversies which have<br>often appeared in the literature pertaining to SEM. Having described the essence of SEM in<br>the context of causal analysis, the author discusses the years of the development of<br>structural modeling as the consequence of many systematically growing needs<br>(in particular in the social sciences) who strove to effectively understand the structure and<br>interactions of latent phenomena. The early beginnings of SEM models were related to the<br>work of Spearman and Wright, and to that of other prominent researchers who contributed<br>to SEM development. The importance and predominance of theoretical assumptions over<br>technical issues for the successful construction of SEM models are also described. Then,<br>controversies regarding the use <a name='215' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#215'><font color='#FF0000'>of SEM in the social sciences </font></a>are presented. Finally, the<br>opportunities and threats of this type of analytical strategy as well as selected areas of SEM<br>applications in the social sciences are discussed.<br>Keywords Structural equation modeling Development and usefulness of SEM<br>Controversies of SEM Areas of applications in social science research<br>Introduction<br>One of the main goals of research in the social sciences, i.e., in the context of recognizing<br>particular concepts and events, is to explain and to predict, in a valid manner, the specific<br>behavior of an individual, group of people or organization. Researchers, by recognizing a<br>Piotr Tarka<br>piotr.tarka@ue.poznan.pl<br>Department of Market Research, Poznan University of Economics, al. Niepodleglosci Poznan, Poland<br>P. Tarka<br>number of conditions in which the individual, society or organization exists, can, within<br>certain limits, identify particular development trends and describe the details concerning<br>their existential sphere. As a result, researchers can define and discover the vital factors and<br>relationships which set trends in a given society. However, the goal of the social sciences is<br>not only to conduct an elementary statistical description and to recognize individual factors<br>and behaviors (which are involved in a specific social situation), but also to determine the<br>cause-effect linkages among the scientific areas (i.e., variables) of interest. Because of the<br>complexity of social reality, i.e., the latent character of many social phenomena, sophisticated methods and techniques of statistical data analysis are required, both of which refer<br>to causal analysis and the procedures of encompassing many variables based on Structural<br>Equation In the statistical sense, this model refers to a set of equations<br>with accompanying assumptions of the analyzed system, in which the parameters are<br>determined on the basis of statistical observation. Thus, structural equations refer to<br>equations using parameters in the analysis of the observable or latent variables and In the latter case of variables, their examples could be such theoretical<br>constructs as: intelligence, alienation, discrimination, socialization, motives of human<br>behavior, personal fulfillment, aggression, frustrations, conservatism, anomie, satisfaction,<br>or attitudes. In the economic sense, these can also be: prosperity of a geographic region,<br>social-economic status, satisfaction from purchased products, approval of products, and<br>improvement of economic conditions. All in all, the measurement of such latent constructs<br>is conducted indirectly, mostly with the use of a set of observable variables and via<br>observation of the causal effects in SEM between respective latent variables.<br>factor analysis as a primary source of structural equation<br>modeling development<br>The dissemination and development of structural modeling (SEM) was the consequence of<br>the growing needs of both academic researchers and social science practitioners who were<br>looking for effective methods in order to understand the structure and interactions of latent<br>phenomena. For years, human motivations have been the source of development for many<br>analytical procedures, thus the early beginnings of SEM development should be reconstructed indirectly on the basis of works as he laid the foundations for SEM by constructing the first factor model which later became an important<br>measurement part of the more general SEM analytical strategy.

SIMPLIS<br>and and GLAMM (Rabe-Hesketh et al. Skrondal and<br>Rabe-Hesketh as well as freeware packages related to an R (open source) statistical<br>environment, such as OpenMX (Development Team SEM package (Fox or<br>LAVAAN (Rosseel The common advantage of all of this software is that it offers<br>highly advanced and fast-speed computational solutions, e.g., in conducting the simulation<br>of experimental plans, and allows to more precisely confirm the correlations between the<br>analyzed variables, together with the available possibility of testing cause-effect relationships, e.g. EQS software can be applied on the basis of syntax. In<br>contrast, in AMOS the path flexible graphical interface can be used instead of<br>syntax. OpenMx, which runs as a package under R and consists of a library of functions<br>and optimizers, supports the rapid and flexible implementation and estimation of SEM<br>models. In consequence, it allows for estimation of models based on either raw data (with<br>FIML modeling) or on correlation or covariance matrices. OpenMx can also handle<br>mixtures of continuous and ordinal data (Neale et al. Likewise as OpenMX, the<br>SEM package provides basic structural equation modeling facilities in R and includes the<br>ability to fit structural equations into observed variable models via the two-stage least<br>squares procedure and to fit latent variable models via full information maximum likelihood assuming multivariate normality. Finally, with the LAAVAN package a large variety<br>of multivariate statistical models can be estimated, including path analysis, confirmatory<br>factor analysis, structural equation modeling and latent growth curve models.<br>Many of the above advancements in software took place at a time when the automated<br>computing process offered substantial upgrades over the existing calculator and analog<br>computing methods that were available then. Admittedly, advances in computer technology have enabled many professionals, as well as novices, to apply structural equation<br>methods to very intensive analyses based on large datasets which refer to often complex,<br>unstructured problems (see the discussion in the work of Westland Progress in SEM model parameter estimation methods<br>While the early 1970s were characterized by achievements in generalizing and synthesizing models developed in econometrics, sociometrics, psychometrics and biometrics, the<br>late 1970s and 1980s made a huge advancement in parameter estimation methods.<br>P. Tarka<br>However, we must remember that early applications of path analysis were based only on ad<br>hoc methods in the estimation of model parameters. The formal approach to the estimation<br>of an SEM model is owed to the work of Goldberger who developed the characteristics of estimators for models with observable variables, and to statisticians such as<br>Anderson and Rubin Lawley as well as Also<br>Bock and Bergman developed covariance structure analysis in estimating the elements of covariance of observable variables having multidimensional, normal distribution<br>and a latent character.<br>Anderson and Rubin created a limited information maximum likelihood estimator for parameters of a single structural equation which indirectly included <a name='198' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#198'><font color='#FF0000'>a two-stage<br>least squares estimator </font></a>and its asymptotic distribution.4 However, as Browne argued<br>(Browne 2000b, p. <a name='90' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#90'><font color='#FF0000'>computational procedures were not available until </font></a>the nested<br><a name='6' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#6'><font color='#FF0000'>algorithms involving eigenvalues and eigenvectors and imposing inequality constraints on<br>unique variance estimates were discovered independently by </font></a><a name='227' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#227'><font color='#FF0000'>and by<br>Jennrich and Robinson </font></a>in his breakthrough article, proposed use<br>of the maximum likelihood estimator but, as he himself admitted, a numerical procedure<br>for obtaining the ML estimates under certain special cases had first been delivered by<br>Howe and Lawley This procedure was also related to confirmatory factor models (Lawley and Maxwell The ML estimator was often a subject of criticism in the literature because of the<br>unrealistic assumptions of the continuous observable, the latent variables (e.g., multivariate<br>normal distributions), and the large sample sizes which were needed to meet the asymptotic properties of this estimator and efficient testing. In the last case, although large<br>sample sizes may generally provide sufficient statistical power (see e.g., Kaplan and<br>precise estimates in SEM, there is no clear consensus among scholars as to the appropriate<br>methods determining adequate sample size in SEM.

It should also be mentioned that MA<br>and SEM were developed under different research traditions, e.g., the statistical theories of<br>MA and SEM were based on distributions of correlations and covariance matrices,<br>respectively. Hence there is no guarantee that inferences based on combining these two<br>approaches will always be correct. Moreover, empirical studies on the validity of these<br>procedures are still rare (Cheung Hafdahl A first assumption that was stated in the literature in the context of combining SEM with<br>MA was fitting the structural equation model on the meta-analyzed covariance or correlation matrix. Subsequently, two (often complementary) approaches were proposed based<br>on univariate and multivariate methods. In the former approach, which is similar to conventional meta-analysis, the class of univariate methods refers to the elements of a correlation matrix which are treated as independent within studies and are pooled separately<br>across studies (e.g., Brown and Peterson The dependency of correlation coefficients<br>(calculated as untransformed correlation coefficients r or transformed coefficients z in<br>meta-analysis, e.g., see the works of Corey et al. Hunter and Schmidt Schulze<br>Cheung and Chan Furlow and Beretvas within the studies is not taken<br>into account (as opposed to multivariate methods), and a population value is estimated for<br>each correlation coefficient separately. Later, when the correlation coefficients are pooled<br>across studies (using the r or z method), one pooled correlation matrix can typically be<br>constructed from separate coefficients, and the hypothesized structural model can then be<br>fit into this matrix as if it were an observed matrix in a sample. Thus the main problems of<br>the univariate methods as referred to in the early development of MA-SEM were: the lack<br>of dependency of the correlation coefficients; non-positive definitive correlation matrices<br>(Wothke due to different elements of the matrix which are based on different<br>samples; lower level of precision in the correlation coefficients; and different results for<br>different sample sizes which are associated with different correlation coefficients.<br>In the case of the latter approach, i.e., the multivariate method, two strategies were<br>proposed, i.e., generalized least squares (Becker and two-stage structural equation<br>modeling (Cheung Cheung and Chan Becker used GLS estimation to<br>pool correlation matrices by taking the dependencies between the correlations into account.<br>That meant not only that the sampling variances but also the sampling covariances in each<br>study could be used to weight the correlation coefficients. Later, as the population<br>parameters become unknown, estimates of the covariances between correlations can be<br>obtained by plugging in sample correlations. However, because estimates from a single<br>study are often not stable, Becker and Fahrbach and Furlow and Beretvas An overview of structural equation modeling: its recommended that pooled estimates of population correlation be used by using the<br>weighted mean correlation across samples. In contrast, in the two-stage structural equation<br>modeling that was proposed by Cheung and Cheung and Chan multi-group<br>SEM could be applied to pool the correlation coefficients at stage one and then in stage<br>two, and the structural model could be fitted to the pooled correlation matrix by using<br>weighted least squares, i.e., the WLS estimator, in which the weight matrix in the WLS<br>procedure represents the inversed matrix with the asymptotic variances and covariances of<br>the pooled correlation coefficients from stage one. This ensured that correlation coefficients which were estimated with more precision (based on more studies) in stage one<br>obtained more weight in the estimation of the model parameters in stage two. However, the<br>precision of a stage-one estimate depended on the number and size of the studies that had<br>reported the specific correlation coefficient.<br>To sum up, the MA-SEM has introduced important quality to SEM by providing an<br>integrative framework analysis in which researchers can pose scientific questions that are<br>not necessarily addressed in one study. Researchers have gained the opportunity to test<br>structural models that have not been tested in any primary study (Viswesvaran and Ones<br>This is a truly attractive feature of the MA-SEM because one can empirically test<br>the viability of a structural model (or perhaps of competing models) by combining the<br>available evidence from potentially disparate literatures. Second, as noted in treatments of<br>SEM (e.g., Barrett Kline strong inferences from tests of structural models are<br>dependent on a sufficiently large sample (i.e., at least cases). Although SEM studies<br>can certainly achieve reasonable sample sizes, meta-analytic correlations are typically<br>generated from samples that far exceed these minimum values, which means that the<br>parameter estimates and fit statistics will be more stable than values generated from any<br>single sample (i.e., primary study) (Landis Also, the MA-SEM was initiated for<br>testing hypothetical models across studies with the same meaning, research context, and<br>with the purpose of a comparison of these models (MaCallum and Austin Multi-group SEM analysis<br>Besides the possibility of comparing research findings in the MA-SEM strategy, the necessity<br>of diagnosing group/sample similarities based on multi-group SEM analysis (MG-SEM) also<br>appeared in the literature. To recall, in the social sciences researchers often have to deal with<br>several samples-groups arising from one or several populations. Consequently, it is important<br>to understand to what extent these might differ 1989a, b). In SEM this can partially<br>be achieved by testing the equivalence of the SEM model parameters, such as factor loadings,<br>path coefficients, or variances of factors (Yuan and Bentler MG-SEM was initiated by who developed a maximum likelihood<br>estimator for SEM with multiple groups, and by who studied differences in<br>the context of factor means across groups. approach later became a generally<br>accepted solution thanks to the work of Browne and Arminger who renamed it the<br>Mean And Covariance Next, Bentler et al. and later (1989a), proposed an alternative approach, i.e., the generalized least squares estimator, and<br>Satorra and Bentler developed scaled tests in the multi-group analysis of moment<br>structures. Finally, (1989b), Yuan and Bentler worked out solutions which<br>helped to eliminate problems with the so-called nonstandard samples (e.g., containing<br>missing data, nonnormal data, and data with outliers).<br>The process of MG-SEM analysis entails that some path coefficients in a multi-group<br>SEM model are constrained equally, while other coefficients remain varying, across<br>P. Tarka<br>groups. By testing the equality or invariance of path coefficients across groups, the<br>researcher obtains the opportunity to examine whether different groups behave similarly<br>(Hayduk Initially, when the population covariance matrices are deemed to be equal<br>across groups, the next step to substantiate the measurement invariance is to check whether<br>the sample covariance matrices in all of the groups can be adequately fitted by the same<br>model. Then the cross-group equalities of factor loadings, error variances, factor variancescovariances and structural paths are taken into account sequentially. We also assume the<br>mean structures, where cross-group equalities of intercepts and factor means are examined.<br>Usually, the golden rule of MG-SEM analysis states that if the statistic at the hypothesized<br>model is not significant at a level of the researcher can move to the next level by<br>using a Chi-square-difference statistic. However, as Yuan and Chan and Yuan et al.<br>argued, this rule is unable to control either type I or type II errors. Therefore, to<br>overcome this problem they suggested to modify the process of testing the null hypothesis<br>via equivalence testing, which allows researchers to effectively control the size of the<br>misspecification before moving on to testing a more restricted model.<br>Latent growth curve modeling<br>Finally, the last milestone in structural equation modeling was latent growth curve modeling (LGCM). In LGCM the analysis is based on repeated measures, in which the latent<br>variables are conceptualized as aspects of change and the factor loadings are interpreted as<br>parameters representing the dependence of the repeated measures on these unobservable<br>aspects of change (see the classic works on the subject written by Meredith and Tisak<br>McArdle and Epstein Willett and Sayer Raudenbush Bollen and<br>Curran Duncan et al. Preacher et al. Because time is an indicator of the<br>modeled trends, in LGCM we model the longitudinal data, in which repeated measurements are observed for some outcome variable, at a number of occasions.<br>The roots of LGCM analysis can be found in panel data modeling (see the comments by<br>Tucker Rao however, it was Meredith and Tisak who <a name='82' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#82'><font color='#FF0000'>published the<br>treatment within an SEM framework that is still relevant today. </font></a>Rao and Tucker constructed a procedure that included unspecified longitudinal curves or functions, while<br><a name='81' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#81'><font color='#FF0000'>Meredith and Tisak showed that individual growth curves, </font></a>which are <a name='187' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#187'><font color='#FF0000'>often modeled within<br>a multi-level or mixed model framework </font></a><a name='16' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#16'><font color='#FF0000'>(Raudenbush and Bryk can be modeled<br>within a standard SEM framework by treating the shape of </font></a>the <a name='93' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#93'><font color='#FF0000'>growth curves as latent<br>variables with multiple indicators </font></a>at multiple time points.

Consequently, latent growth models can be imbedded<br>in many theoretical models, thus allowing for a more comprehensive and flexible approach<br>to research design and data analysis than any other single statistical model for longitudinal<br>data in standard use in the social sciences.

This development even allows to treat SEM as a more general analytical strategy.<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its Finally, the hybrid of the <a name='151' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#151'><font color='#FF0000'>latent growth and latent class </font></a>models should be mentioned that<br>was proposed in by Nagin and Land, who developed a model based on the group<br>trajectory.

The statistical aspects mainly refer to specific<br>technical-methodological problems, whereas the philosophical aspects refer mainly to the<br>ontological nature of causality and to the role of SEM in the epistemology of causal<br>inference on the basis of experimental or nonexperimental data. All in all, the practical<br>issues of using SEM models in research can be boiled down to difficulties in the application of such types of models because of their high level of complexity (see e.g., Bagozzi<br>1983a; Breckler Cliff Fornell Tomarken and Weller Below we<br>will explain in detail some of the problems and controversies pertaining to the construction<br>and application of SEM models.<br>Problems in understanding the role of the null hypothesis and equivalence<br>in SEM models<br>One of the main difficulties in using SEM is the reversed role of the null hypothesis which<br>complicates the process of statistical inference, particularly in the course of interpretation<br>of the model results. Yet another factor that influences SEM is the ontological character of<br>the validity of the tested model. We assume that the tested model is exactly true when<br>testing the overall fit of an SEM model; however, such a model only approximately<br>represents substantive processes, which means that the hypothesis explaining the exact<br>goodness of fit of the model is a priori false. SEM models represent only approximate<br>estimates of the substantive processes. Consequently, the only realistic hypothesis that<br>might be assumed is the hypothesis of the near/close fit (Cudeck and Henly MacCallum and Tucker Browne and Cudeck conducting their studies based<br>on the work of Linhart and Zucchini presented even conceptual and mathematical<br>strategies allowing for the representation and evaluation of various sources of errors in the<br>relationship between models and empirical processes. Their work allowed for the formal<br>identification of many critical aspects of testing SEM models, such as test of close fit<br>(Browne and Cudeck cross validation (Browne 2000a), and statistical power<br>analysis (MacCallum et al. Moreover, factors which complicate inference from SEM refer to the problem of<br>equivalence. To recall, equivalent models represent various patterns of relationships<br>between variables but also have the same number of free parameters (and degrees of<br>freedom) and the same statistical values of the model fit. Thus equivalent models are<br>P. Tarka<br>hardly ever comparable only on the basis of statistical criteria. MaaCallum et al. demonstrated that for each substantive model one can actually create one or more<br>equivalent models; therefore, models of this kind complicate quality assessment in SEM.<br>Regardless of the adequacy of the proposed theoretical model and the level attained, other<br>alternative models may have an equivalent degree of fit to the sample matrix S. Consequently, any failure to reject the proposed model does not automatically mean confirmation<br>of the veracity of that model (Cliff James et al. In other words, the presence of<br>equivalent models reminds us that although an inadequate fit of the model to the data<br>implies the failure of the proposed theoretical model, an adequate fit does not necessarily<br>confirm the validity of the proposed substantive process. A truly valid model of the<br>substantive process reflects just one of many possible models which have an adequate fit to<br>the data.<br>Difficulties in the specification and modification of SEM models<br>Another source of controversy is inappropriate specification and modification of the SEM<br>model. The idea of a was discussed by MacCallum but was<br>originally described by Leamer as the process of modifying the model in order to<br>either simplify or improve its fit to the empirical data. Thus, modification seems to be<br>necessary for all SEM models because they rarely pass the test of fit when compared with<br>the set of data in the first stage.<br>There are two general types of specification errors. The first error can be caused by<br>omission, while the second is based on inclusion of more parameters in the SEM model<br>than it requires. In order to eliminate these errors, researchers are allowed to use the<br>strategy of a or specification search. The forward specification<br>corrects any omissions of parameters. The process usually starts with a more restricted<br>model and then leads towards a more general model (Bentler and Chou Chou and<br>Bentler Errors are usually detected by LM (Lagrange Multiplier) tests or the EPC<br>(Expected Parameter Change) index (see e.g., Bollen 1989a). On the other hand, the<br>backward strategy corrects any possible errors of inclusion. The process begins with a<br>more general model and continues towards a more restricted model which is verified with<br>the W (Wald) test.<br>A problematic issue with the above strategies is that there is no literature consensus as<br>to which is the best strategy. In particular, this lack of agreement is visible when discussing<br>the errors, sample errors, or violations of normality in the variables (Green et al.<br>MacCallum Hayduk Another problem is that a model which is theoretically too complex is deprived of the basics in substantive theory. As a result, and as<br>Wheaton argued, SEM models always undergo modification to improve their fit to<br>the data, which also means that every model becomes empirically determined and<br>simultaneously loses its status of an a priori hypothesis. Bollen (1989b) even claimed that<br>modification in the initial model leads to a purely exploratory analysis; therefore, the<br>probability levels of tests related to statistical significance for new (modified) versions of<br>the models should be regarded as only approximations (Bollen 1989b). Also Byrne p. explained that a hypothesized model has been rejected, this spells the end of<br>the SEM as the analytic approach, in its true sense. Although SEM procedures continue to<br>be used in any respecification and re-estimation of the model, these analyses are<br>exploratory in the sense that they focus on the detection of misfitting parameters in the<br>originally hypothesized Thus, any changes ever made to the model are actually<br>data-driven and lead the researcher from the realm of hypothesis testing or confirmatory<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its analysis to the domain of exploratory analysis. On the other hand, Arbuckle p. added that trying to improve a model the researcher should not be guided exclusively<br>by modification requirements. A modification should be considered only if it makes theoretical or common If it is not, such a strategy is prone, through capitalization on<br>chance, to produce absurd models with satisfying Chi-square values but which are deprived<br>of theoretical sense. These issues were discussed extensively by MacCallum and<br>MacCallum et al. Errors caused by omission of important variables in SEM models<br>The practical implications of using SEM models also lead to problems regarding the<br>omission of important variables in the model. The selection of variables comprises a<br>critical element of SEM model construction since the errors of omission of important<br>variables (both exogenous and endogenous) have an influence on every parameter of the<br>tested SEM model. Just as in the case of omitting particular parameters, the omission of<br>important variables leads to biased parameter estimation and incorrect standard errors.<br>The issue of omitting important variables in SEM was described generally from the<br>perspective of unmeasured variables (James Sackett et al. Tomarken and<br>Weller however, Cohen and Cohen have also researched the issue<br>from the perspective of obtaining spurious relationships. Finally, James et al. and<br>Bollen (1989a) addressed this issue from the perspective of the self-containment violation<br>or pseudo-isolation of the equation system for causal inference. In the assumptions<br>underlying pseudo-isolation, researchers may believe that each equation of the examined<br>model possesses a sufficiently large number of important exogenous variables and that the<br>residuals in the equations include only random disturbances that are not correlated with<br>exogenous variables. As we know, biases in model parameters caused by the omission of<br>important observable variables (exogenous or endogenous) apply to all tested types of<br>SEM models. Thus the problem of pseudo-isolation is a serious threat to causal inference in<br>SEM analysis.<br>Given the above, James pointed out that the relevant questions posed by<br>researchers should not refer to the issue of whether there is a problem in omitting variables<br>but about what the magnitude is due to the consequences this problem has on the estimated<br>parameters in the hypothesized model. Unfortunately, there are no simple mechanisms<br>which might help to accurately detect that magnitude. This problem still remains unsolved,<br>though there are two forms that this issue can be addressed by. The first approach is called<br>the test of an incorrectly specified model (Arminger and Schoenberg and was<br>adopted from test while the second approach relies on sensitivity<br>analysis. The problem with test lies in its high sensitivity level that is caused by<br>a correlation between residuals in the equations and the exogenous variables. Therefore,<br>although idea is, on an intuitive level, relatively simple to understand, in<br>practical terms its implementation will be complicated. Besides, the test has two limitations: first, it is sensitive to violation of normality distribution of the residuals; second,<br>simulation studies have showed (Long and Trivedi that test does not<br>provide the optimal properties for small sample sizes.<br>The second approach, i.e. sensitivity analysis, was created by Rosenbaum and<br>further developed by Mauro and Frank in estimating the structural path<br>coefficients, assuming various levels in the values of correlations (theoretically probable<br>and empirically acceptable) between the exogenous variable (omitted in the model), and<br>variables (endogenous and exogenous) which were already included. A direct transposition<br>P. Tarka<br>of the sensitivity analysis from the regression model on SEM might be, however, challenging for a researcher who might be ready to use this method but may not know the<br>methodological nuances. Actually, a sensitivity analysis assumes knowledge not just about<br>the omitted variables in the model but also about the relationships of these variables with<br>other variables in the model. To sum up, the effects of omitting an important variable in the<br>SEM model (either exogenous or endogenous) depend on the form of the tested SEM<br>models, the role of the omitted variable in the model, and the pattern of relationships<br>between the excluded variables and the variables included in the model.<br>Problems with multicollinearity in SEM<br>Another issue that largely complicates the inference process in SEM analysis is multicollinearity. The problem of multicollinearity stems from the inclusion of redundant<br>variables in model, as these carry a limited level of information. In this sense, multicollinearity represents the inverse of problems pertaining to the omission of important<br>variables in SEM analysis. However, similarly to omitting important variables in the<br>model, multicollinearity can challenge the results of SEM analysis. In the context of SEM,<br>as compared to regression analysis, multicollinearity results from too strong a relationship<br>between observable data and a particular form of the tested model. Models strongly vulnerable to multicollinearity are those which propose moderating relationships (Little et al.<br>as well as latent growth curve models (Biesanz et al. Despite the potentially serious consequences for statistical inference, the problem of<br>multicollinearity has been relatively little investigated in the context of SEM. Researchers<br>have not paid sufficient attention to the possible consequences of multicollinearity on SEM<br>(Grewal et al. In fact, this knowledge contrasts with advanced knowledge on<br>regression models for which methods of detection and correction of multicollinearity based<br>on the variance inflation factor (VIF) or variance-decomposition proportion (VDP) (see<br>e.g., the works of Belsley Cohen and Cohen Draper and Smith have<br>already been developed. Also, the approach to overcoming the problem of multicollinearity<br>in SEM is far more difficult than in the case of classical regression models, e.g., in SEM the<br>independent variables can be both exogenous X and endogenous Y, and in regression<br>analysis the incorrect configuration of the variables simply refers to exogenous, i.e.<br>independent variables X. Moreover, in SEM the variables, being in strong multicollinearity, can assume a latent character. Another difference refers to the relation<br>between estimation of the model parameter variance and the independent variables that<br>remain in a linear relationship. In the regression model, each independent variable is<br>connected only with one estimation of the model parameter variance, whereas in the SEM<br>model one independent variable can be connected with estimations of a few model<br>parameter variances. This problem becomes even more complex when strong multicollinearity concerns two or more parameters which correlate latent variables.<br>The issue of multicollinearity in SEM models, particularly concerning the consequences<br>of multicollinearity for statistical inference, can also be described in the context of empirical<br>underidentification (Grewal et al. Kenny pointed to multicollinearity between<br>observable exogenous variables of the S matrix as one of the main causes of empirical<br>underidentification of the model. Also, Rindskopf Bollen (1989a), Kenny et al. Kenny developed the notion of empirical underidentification in situations in which researchers,<br>despite assuring the identification of the model, cannot achieve a clear-cut solution for the model parameters<br>in the analyzed S matrix of covariance.<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its developed the notion of empirical underidentification of the SEM model as an effect of<br>multicollinearity between latent variables. On the other hand, Hayduk created a visual<br>analysis <a name='156' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#156'><font color='#FF0000'>of the covariance matrix of </font></a>estimates pertaining to model parameters as a way to<br>diagnose multicollinearity. Finally, Kaplan developed the approach of Hayduk by using dependency analysis of the correlation matrix based on SEM model parameter<br>estimates. With this purpose in mind, he used the so-called conditioning number, conditioning index and decomposition of variances (originally applied to incorrect conditioning of<br>the XTX matrix in regression models) as measures of incorrect conditioning of the correlation<br>matrix of parameter estimates in the tested SEM model. These solutions were considered<br>from the perspective of two primary levels. At the first level, the problem of multicollinearity<br>was described in the context of an independency of the tested model and referred only to the<br>domain of conditioning covariance matrix S for observable variables. At the second level, the<br>multicollinearity problem was characterized as a dependent form from the tested model. Both<br>forms of multicollinearity may be engaged in the fallacious process of inference associated<br>with SEM, hence both require separate approaches to diagnose and correct the multicollinearity. Also, standard estimators such as ML, GLS, and ADF often require a positivedefinitive S matrix. Consequently, extremely incorrect data conditioning, which creates the<br>effect of singularity of the S matrix, disqualifies the results of the SEM analysis. Given this,<br>Wothke proposed a method of diagnosing the poor conditioning of the S matrix on the<br>basis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Another solution that was proposed in the case of<br>singularity of the S matrix concerned the application of a ridge estimator and<br>and a maximum entropy estimator.<br>Because there are no simple ways of correcting the problem of multicollinearity, the<br>analytical strategies may refer to finding compromises between three elements, i.e., data,<br>methods of parameter estimation, or the form of the tested model. When making a correction of the poor conditioning of the S matrix, one can extend the existing dataset with<br>new units in the sample. However, this approach does not guarantee improvement and<br>correct conditioning of the S matrix. On the other hand, incorrect conditioning can be<br>regulated by deleting redundant observable variables. Unfortunately, this approach requires<br>a re-specification of the SEM model. Simultaneously, poor conditioning of the S matrix<br>can be overcome by implementing the ridge or ULS (unweighted least squares) estimators.<br>Finally, the correction strategy can be boiled down to a reformulation of the tested model.<br>In extreme cases, such a modification may lead to a change (reduction) in the number of<br>latent variables, e.g., by investigating the discriminant validity between the latent variables, and in less extreme cases one can enter equality restrictions on the estimated<br>parameters of the tested model which remain in a strong linear dependency.<br>Relationships between model fit and strength of correlation<br>of the observable variables<br>The last statistical problem to be discussed here which complicates inference on the basis<br>of the SEM model is the negative relationship between measures expressing the general<br>(absolute) fit of the model and the strength of the correlation of the observable variables in<br>S (Fornell Fornell and Larcker Marsh et al. 2004a, b). To recall, a weak<br>correlation between the observable variables increases the probability of achieving a good<br>fit of the model. Fornell and Larcker pointed out, over a quarter of a century ago,<br>that if the correlations of the observable variables are sufficiently weak, almost every<br>(correct or incorrect) model will have an adequate level of the matrix fit measured with the<br>use of the Chi-square statistic and of the derivative descriptive measures of a general fit.<br>P. Tarka<br>Simultaneously, Browne et al. pointed to such a dependency in the context of<br>reliable measurements. The effect of this dependency can be a rejection of the correct<br>model, e.g., when the level of model reliability is high, or acceptance of the incorrect<br>model in conditions of low reliability of the measurement. Later, Tomarken and Weller<br>stressed two discrepancies that appear between measures expressing the absolute fit<br>and the statistics of the examined SEM model parameters. The first discrepancy is caused<br>by a negative relationship between the level of measurement reliability and the fit of the<br>model, while the second is caused by the positive relationship between measurement<br>precision and estimation precision (which is expressed in lower standard errors) of the<br>SEM model. In SEM, the former relationship is highly undesirable, while the latter option<br>is highly expected.<br>To sum up, information about the relationship between measures of the general model<br>fit and observable variables in the S matrix as well as the reliability indices carries<br>tremendous implications for the practice of SEM model analysis. Being aware of these<br>relationships requires us to make appropriate conclusions, e.g., whether the good fit of the<br>model is not by any chance the result of low correlations between the observable variables<br>considered in the model. Such conclusions can be conducted almost on the basis of the<br>correlation R matrix before proceeding to a final interpretation of the model. Consequently,<br>in SEM models with latent variables, low reliability will signal that, formally, a good fit of<br>the tested model to the S matrix was probably obtained due to low correlations between the<br>observable variables. The reverse situation is also possible, e.g., if the hypothesized model<br>does not appropriately fit the S matrix but simultaneously obtains a higher level of reliability, one can conclude that the source of this mismatch is not the inadequacy of the model<br>but a very good selection of the measurement instrument (Browne et al. controversies in the domain of SEM model<br>usefulness<br>Apart from the technical issues as mentioned above, difficulties in using SEM <a name='217' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#217'><font color='#FF0000'>models in<br>the social sciences </font></a>also appear in the domain of philosophical arguments. The main<br>ontological critique of SEM is the latent reality <a name='216' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#216'><font color='#FF0000'>in the social sciences which </font></a>is so complex<br>that even a simplified statistical model of this reality can be of no cognitive significance.<br>On the other hand, the main epistemological argument states that the use of SEM with<br>nonexperimental data only misleads researchers by creating the illusion of causal process<br>modeling. We will discuss these problems in depth.<br>The ontological argument claims that it is impossible to transform the investigated<br>phenomenon into a limited mathematical form (i.e., into a system of structural equations)<br>which would justify certain regularities in social life. Moreover, even if such regularities<br>exist, or processes of data generation are found, they are often doomed to be outdated soon<br>after their identification because the availability of new sources of data outdates the theory.<br>The advocates of ontological arguments (e.g., Cartwright Fox Rogosa<br>pointed out that social reality in the world is so complicated and<br>simultaneously to many changes that its representation in the form of mathematical<br>rules is impossible, and that the statistical models constructed for such substantive processes can only be a simplification of this world. Cartwright believed that an essential<br>element of SEM model construction is horizontal reductionism which limits, to a greater<br>extent, the scope of possible applications of the model or its Also, Fox pointed out that substantive theories in the social sciences are often vague, imprecise, and<br>highly relative. As a result, any statistical binding of such theories with empirical reality is<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its extremely difficult. Rogosa even stated that the causal SEM models<br>have no scientific value because they represent models of relations between variables and<br>do not represent causal processes at the level of the individual. Substantive processes take<br>place in individuals and not between variables. Thus a model which ignores the individual<br>process of data generation is of little substantive use.<br>However, when we consider the ontological assumptions, the argument of the openness<br>of social life and the SEM limitations are not new. In any case, this argument was<br>the main source of disagreement regarding path analysis between Wright and Niles<br>Wright p. was fully aware that the path coefficients in a system<br>of causes and effects can be calculated if a sufficient number of simultaneous equations can<br>be made expressing the known correlations in terms of the unknown path coefficients and<br>expressing the complete determination of the causes to effects. Niles believed,<br>however, that the lack of profound knowledge regarding the mechanisms of the causal<br>process eliminates the usefulness of path analysis. Wright accepted the human<br>inability to acquire thorough knowledge regarding the causal process but, at the same time,<br>he claimed that selective knowledge about the causal process allows one to isolate a part of<br>this system and to calculate the relative correlation of the variables in this isolated part of a<br>wider system.<br>Also, the presentation of other consequences related to SEM, including the specification<br>of errors and consequences of omitting important variables, raises controversial issues<br>which have an influence on the appropriate statistical inference conducted on the basis of<br>SEM. However, we must not forget that all of these doubts can take on the form of extreme<br>expansionism in either denying or questioning any attempt of description of the substantive<br>processes analyzed from the perspective of statistical models such as SEM. We cannot<br>forget that the exclusive knowledge of the correctness of the constructed model, or the<br>inclusion of all necessary variables for the sake of the analyzed phenomenon, is possessed<br>by a higher being only. Thus Glymour just as Wright and the vast majority<br>of scholars (MaCallum were fully aware that SEM models are a priori at least to<br>some extent imperfect but, on the other hand, they believed that valuable knowledge can be<br>available through SEM, which, however, does not exempt one from striving to have full<br>awareness of the limitations of such an analytical strategy.<br>Finally, the epistemological argument refers to the significance and role of SEM models<br>in causal analysis. As Meehl and Waller noticed, some researchers (such as Blalock<br>Heckman Irzik and Meyer Pearl 1998a, b, adopted the SEM<br>strategy as the best way of causal inference with nonexperimental data, while others (e.g.,<br>Freedman Sobel thought that using SEM would be misleading because<br>it gives a promise or an illusion of causal process modeling with nonexperimental data.<br>The current consensus has been reached more in the direction of a careful application of<br>SEM as an established method of investigating causal relationships from the perspective of<br>nonexperimental data (see, for example, papers by McDonald Meehl and Waller<br>These controversies surrounding the SEM role in causal inference should not be<br>surprising because, as Cook and Campbell explained a long time ago, the epistemology of causal inference remains in a productive state of chaos. This view was also<br>confirmed in a discussion between Cartwright and Glymour as well as<br>between Humphreys and Freedman as it concerned the conditions enabling causal<br>inference from passive observations.<br>Perhaps the most fervent critic of SEM models and their applications in causal analysis<br>was Freedman who argued that SEM only distracts the attention<br>from real issues such as a strong substantive theory, an adequate research plan and an<br>P. Tarka<br>adequate process of data collection. The SEM, according to point of view,<br>promises something that is actually unavailable in the process of applying a statistical<br>model, as long as there exists limited knowledge on the subject of modeling substantive<br>processes. Cartwright raised the same issue by claiming that causal processes are<br>developed as the effect of multiple smaller causal mechanisms that cooperate and interact<br>with one another. Knowledge concerning such types of mechanisms does not come from<br>statistical data, and when this knowledge is already gathered, statistics soon become<br>unimportant since the causal processes have been identified. Freedman also<br>claimed that despite the statistical theory allowing to investigate the problems of measurement errors, new solutions based on nonlinearity,9 or the omission of important<br>variables in SEM models, it does not enable one to test these problems and to completely<br>eliminate them from SEM. Freedman indicated that the practice of making up for<br>the restrictions of the substantive theory or the research plan and involving many competing models is also counterproductive. In response to these critics, Wright argued that path analysis was not expanded in order to discover the cause or causal<br>relationships. Wright also pointed out that it is necessary to possess some knowledge about the substantive theory rather than to entirely rely on path analysis as a statistical<br>method of generating this theory. Similarly, Duncan stated that no statistical<br>method can be used as a final test of causal order and quoted the following words stated by<br>Fisher p. we choose a group of social phenomena with no antecedent<br>knowledge of the causation or absence of causation among them, then the calculation of<br>correlation coefficients, total or partial, will not advance us a step towards evaluating the<br>importance of Finally, Pearl (1998a), when responding to Breckler again<br>stressed that the knowledge or theory concerning causal relations is necessary because the<br>observable relationships in a set of data cannot be the sole basis for causal inference.<br>Later, Freedman admitted that his arguments were based mainly on common<br>sense, however, the world of science reacted to his critiques, claiming that most of the<br>empirical applications in patch analysis have nothing to do with causal analysis, so the<br>causality language must be replaced with a better language based on prediction 1987b). There were even scholars (Bentler who claimed that critiques<br>were simply the result of ignoring contemporary achievements that had been generated<br>within this analytical strategy. However, despite all of these reactions, critiques became an important impulse for considering causal analysis and the<br>role of statistical models in causal analysis in nonexperimental research (i.e., Heckman<br>Cox and Wermuth Dawid Abbott Marini and Singer Sobel<br>Pearl Holland As a consequence, causal<br>analysis now covers two objectives. From one point of view it realizes the objective<br>pertaining to some kind of activity (action) and thus supports social practice and diagnosis.<br>From the other point of view, a causal analysis realizes cognitive objectives pertaining to<br>scientific explanation. Holland Dawid Heckman and Cox and<br>Comments on nonlinear relationships and nonlinear interaction between variables or issues concerning<br>methods allowing to specify and to test interaction models and nonlinear effects in reference to SEM models<br>can be found in papers by Schumaker and Marcoulides Yang-Wallentin et al. Moulder and<br>Algina Lee et al. Cortina et al. and Marsh et al. (2004a, b). Particular attention should<br>be paid to the work of McDonald Mooijaart and Bentler who developed the statistical<br>basics of models consisting of nonlinear relationships between variables and nonlinear interactions. In some<br>part these works were connected with the work of Kenny and Judd Since then there have been many<br>developments allowing to test mediation and moderation (interaction) in SEM which even led to a new<br>software package based on R for nonlinear SEM.<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its Wermuth indicated that these two areas of causal thinking require some kind of<br>alternative approach or statistical treatment, e.g., obtaining action-oriented objectives<br>requires thinking about the effects of causes or the magnitude of the causal effect, whereas<br>obtaining the cognitive objective requires thinking about the causes of effects when we<br>want to understand causal relationships between theoretical constructs. The analysis of the<br>effects of causes is typically related to an analysis of counterfactuals (Holland Rosenbaum and Rubin whereas the analysis of the causes of effects refers to an<br>analysis of the structural model (Cox and Wermuth Heckman However, up to<br>now there has been no consensus as to which of these two objectives is possible to achieve<br>through the postulate and test of the statistical model in the case of nonexperimental data.<br>This discussion was continued by Holland who developed the approach of counterfactual states to the analysis of a simple recursive structural model, whereas Steyer<br>presented concepts of individual and moderate causal effects which were central to<br>the counterfactual approach within the SEM framework. Holland also promoted the<br>issue that the variable gender or other factual variables which are not changeable cannot be<br>introduced as causes to a model. This scholar argued that causes can only be variables<br>which can be changed or manipulated. This was a valuable contribution to the development<br>of SEM. Later, Pearl (1998a, starting from graph theory (Wright developed<br>the theory of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which connected the counterfactual<br>approach with the SEM model in a more common theoretical framework. These and other<br>solutions in SEM made it possible to understand the meaning (the interpretation) of<br>equations and structural coefficients of the model and allowed to determine the conditions<br>within which the equations and coefficients may assume a causal interpretation. However,<br>we also need to be cautious of the results of SEM analysis which can often be empirically<br>overweighted. Consequently, if the hypothesized model is only empirically determined, at<br>minimal theory input, then such a model is simply a convenient summary of a covariance<br>matrix. The interpretation of this equations expresses only the statistical relationships between variables in reference to the analyzed set of data. If, however, the tested<br>SEM model is theoretically determined by a strong theory, then it receives the status of<br>representing stable causal relationships in the empirical process of data processing. But<br>even when taking these arguments into account we must still admit that in the literature<br>there is no explicit consensus regarding the matter of determining the exact conditions<br>allowing for causal analysis in SEM. This controversy became the main reason for many<br>divisions between researchers who decided to implement the inductive approach in SEM<br>(e.g., Scheines et al. those who claimed that causal analysis in SEM can be conducted only on theoretical foundations if they are supported by additional conditions (e.g.,<br>Cox and Wermuth Heckman Kenny Pearl 1998a), and those who simply<br>rejected any possibility of analyzing causal processes in the form of the SEM model,<br>particularly in reference to nonexperimental data (e.g., Freedman Holland For example, inductive algorithms dedicated to discovering causal relationships were<br>developed by Glymour et al. and further improved by Scheines et al. as well as Spirtes et al.

In research in which the process of selection is not random (quasiexperiments and nonexperiments), the identification of important correlates of this selection<br>constitutes a cornerstone for conducting valid causal inference. It has been stated that a good<br>causal SEM model should include at least two kinds of exogenous variables: X of which the<br>causal effects remain in the area of substantive theory and variables Z which represent<br>correlates of the selection process.

The directions of all advances<br>probably vary according to the substantive problems which individuals face in various<br>disciplines. Thus SEM models can be extensively applied in the analyses of many processes and phenomena occurring, for example, in sociology, pedagogy, social policy, and<br>the family sciences. They can also, which is extremely important, be applied in explaining<br>economic phenomena, particularly in economy (see papers by Haavelmo Epstein<br>Aldrich Golob Rao and Holt or in marketing research (e.g.,<br>For those interested in gaining more knowledge on the consequences of randomization and passive<br>observation of causal inferences, please refer to the works of Pratt and Schalifer Sobel or Pearl P. Tarka<br>Fornell Anderson and Gerbing Bagozzi 1983b, Bagozzi and Yi Hulland et al. Baumgartner and Homburg Chin et al. The generalizations of the SEM model mentioned in this article have also provided a basis for its broad<br>use in <a name='194' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#194'><font color='#FF0000'>psychology (e.g., Bentler and Speckart </font></a>Kohn and Schooler Bynner and<br>Romney Chassin et al. MaCallum and Austin Karimi and Meyer demographic research (e.g., Beckman et al. Thompson Linver et al. biology (Shipley Pugesek et al. genetics (e.g., Li Evans et al. Liu<br>et al. or even in the medical sciences (e.g., Wheaton Chen and Land<br>Bentler and Stein Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh Raina et al. Stephenson et al. and in criminology (Matsueda Matsueda and Heimer Gibbs et al. Gau In short, the SEM approach, through its generality, can<br>prospectively be applied in many different sciences; however, this does not yet mean that<br>structural equation modeling is indeed applied by scholars in particular areas of the abovementioned sciences. In fact, a recently published work by Saris and Revilla showed<br>that in major journals in sociology, political science, and marketing, hardly any of the<br>considered analytical models (which included latent variables) paid attention to issues of<br>correction of the measurement errors, though these are the main reasons in the application<br>of the SEM approach.<br>Admittedly, the advantage of SEM models over other approaches and statistical models<br>is, above all, the fact that SEM allows to conduct a complex, multidimensional, and more<br>precise analysis of empirical data taking into account different aspects of the examined<br>reality and abstract concepts or theoretical constructs. To provide a simple example here,<br>we can consider a theoretical construct measuring human intelligence which is not analyzed directly as it is in case of height or weight, but only through instruments designed to<br>measure latent variables. Another good example can be studies related to marketing, in<br>which SEM models provide explanations for constructs such as satisfaction and customer<br>loyalty, or studies referring to relationships between personal values and their<br>hedonic purchase behaviors (Steenkamp and Baumgartner Also, in management,<br>SEM models (Shook et al. Marcoulides have proved their usefulness in<br>examining, for example, relationships between market orientation strategies employed by<br>companies or by the learning organization and attitudes expressed by the staff towards<br>market research effectiveness (Tarka Thus analyses which are based on SEM offer<br>more than the classical methods known in statistics. More importantly, the generality of<br>SEM can be evidenced in the ability to parameterize the SEM to estimate a well-known<br>class of alternative approaches known as general linear modeling (GLM) which includes,<br>among others, the t test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, or multiple<br>regression. The SEM can be expanded to estimate measurement errors through the use of<br>multiple indicator latent factors, the testing of complex mediational mechanisms through<br>the decomposition of effects, and the testing of moderational mechanisms through estimation of multiple group analysis, just to name a few. Thus any linear model (e.g.,<br>regression) seems to be slightly worse as compared to SEM, not only due to the omission<br>of correction in the measurement errors but also because of the fact that it is possible to<br>ignore the indirect effects. Unquestionably, SEM is a significant and indispensable tool for<br>empirical researchers. As Fornell argued, SEM reflects the second generation of<br>statistical techniques that can be used to test the extent to which the respective research<br>meets the recognized standards for high quality statistical analysis (Cook and Campbell<br>In the first generation of techniques, Fornell included, among others, analytical methods such as multidimensional scaling, exploratory factor analysis, canonical<br>analysis, variance analysis, or regression analysis, claiming that the advantage of SEM<br>An overview of structural equation modeling: its mainly consists in the possibility of identifying exact measurement errors during analysis,<br>using abstract, non-observable constructs in the examined reality, analyzing their correlations, and confronting the given theory with the obtained empirical data. Thus SEM allows<br>researchers to answer a set of interrelated questions in a single, systematic, and comprehensive analysis by modeling the relationships among multiple independent and dependent<br>theoretical constructs simultaneously (Gerbing and Anderson This capability for<br>simultaneous analysis greatly differs from most first generation statistical models (e.g., linear<br>regression, LOGIT, ANOVA, MANOVA) which analyze only one layer of the linkages<br>between independent and dependent variables at a time. Also classical statistical models, such<br>as variance analysis, canonical analysis, or even discriminant analysis, make it only possible<br>to conduct measurement on the basis of a single linkage between sets of dependent and<br>independent variables, whereas structural modeling (SEM) makes it possible to simultaneously analyze data sets with many series of different linkages. Consequently, SEM allows for<br>complicated variable relationships to be expressed through hierarchical or non-hierarchical<br>and recursive or non-recursive structural equations, and to present a more complete picture of<br>the entire model (Hanushek and Jackson Moreover, as Bagozzi claimed, SEM<br>makes researchers define their research problems more precisely with reference to the<br>examined phenomenon, makes them formulate clear targets and research hypotheses before<br>starting the analyses, makes them provide precise definitions of the considered theoretical<br>constructs and their further operationalization, and forces them to find the right, logic relationships between the constructs. Also, intricate causal networks enable SEM to characterize<br>real-world processes better than simple correlation-based models. Therefore, SEM is more<br>suited for the mathematical modeling of complex processes to serve both the theory and<br>practice. SEM also provides a much better formal way not only to verify a given theory but<br>also to conduct this verification on the basis of the analyzed measures, and because they join<br>and at the same time confront the two spaces, i.e., theory and empirical data, they offer<br>researchers a huge potential in the scientific explanation of phenomena alongside simple<br>descriptive statistics or simple empirical relationships. As a consequence, researchers who<br>choose the SEM model handle the analytical task with more precision than in the case of the<br>procedure belonging to statistics. The application of SEM analysis in the social<br>sciences permits their development, because SEM, more effectively than ever, confronts the<br>with which results not only in optimizations of theoretical models<br>but also leads to the optimization of tools used for the diagnosis of reality.<br>To sum up, researchers representing different fields of the social sciences can, or rather<br>should, rely on SEM analysis and models in their research. The use of SEM will allow<br>them to analyze complex research problems based on an analysis of cause-effect phenomena. It is the very complex structure of social phenomena that creates a growing<br>demand for the use of SEM models, which are supposed to the social phenomena<br>precisely. In other words, the researcher, when beginning to construct theoretical models<br>which aspire to explain complex scientific problems of a social character, is, thanks to<br>empirical verification, capable of gaining a better understanding of the importance of the<br>examined phenomena. However, before the construction process of SEM models starts, the<br>researcher should remember to maintain all theoretical assumptions in the SEM analysis.<br>As it is known, in SEM the researcher should try, above all, to test the structure of<br>covariance of the observable variables with the use of a simplified model structure and on<br>the basis of the formalized elements. Thus SEM models are the synthesis of<br>theoretical knowledge and current empirical results regarding the examined phenomena.<br>The aim of the model construction is as simple an of the examined phenomena as possible, whereas the model itself should be coherent with the empirical<br>P. Tarka<br>observations. To recall, in science the explanation of an event is the logical deduction of<br>that specific event from the true laws and background conditions surrounding the occurrence of that event (see Hempel Simultaneously, the process of model verification<br>is, above all, a hypothetical-deductive process because the suggested model is constructed<br>a priori and then confronted with the empirical set of observations. Scientists assess the<br>validity of the hypothesis by empirically testing the other deductive consequences of that<br>hypothesis.<br>Mulaik and James p. once even stated that the equation model as<br>a representation of an objective state of affairs that stands in causal and/or criterial relationships with the data, and thereby as a causal explanation of the data, does not only<br>reproduce the data. Something more is required with SEM: evidence supporting the<br>assertion that the state of affairs represented by the model exists as represented, independently of the Structural equation models as mathematical models represent<br>an objective state of affairs. In SEM analysis we do not make such assumptions that apply<br>to statistical exploratory models, which means that we do not use the SEM model to find<br>out something about the empirical data but, conversely, we use the given set of observations to verify the theory through the agency of the SEM model, or, actually, we try to<br>explain to what extent the model reflects previous research or the theoretical assumptions<br>which are the basis for the construction (Kelloway That is why in SEM<br>strategy researchers should not accept models at any price even when the tests used on<br>them suggest that they should indeed do so. This would lead nowhere. SEM models are a<br>kind of test and which, on the basis of obtained empirical data and its<br>verification, interferes with the whole process of explaining complex phenomena in light of<br>a given theory. If the theory accepts rational justifications, the logic premises of a given<br>phenomenon, and is, in other words, true, then it is the verification (with the use of SEM<br>models) that should give evidence in the form of empirical results and, more specifically,<br>we should express this evidence via the direction and values of the coefficients describing<br>the relationships between the theoretical constructs which are considered in SEM analysis.<br>On the contrary, if the model does not confirm the theory then we can draw two conclusions, i.e., proving that either the theory is wrong or that the material (empirical data) on<br>the basis of which the SEM model was constructed is of poor quality.<br>At the same time, the fact that a given theory was confirmed by the SEM model does not<br>yet mean that the theoretical assumptions should be considered as unquestionable, i.e.,<br>these assumptions only become more reliable and valid in light of the obtained results.<br>They receive confirmation in the context of the conducted statistical analyses, on the basis<br>of the adopted criteria in these analyses and of the levels of the theoretical assessment of<br>the phenomena (Bollen and Long Therefore, a positive verification of the hypothetical relationships existing in the SEM model does not yet mean the end of the analyses,<br>as we allow for the probability of building another theoretical model which can be far<br>better than the previous one. What is more, for a given set of variables the researcher is<br>usually able to determine many models representing completely different theoretical<br>consequences but having an equivalent fit to the empirical data. Therefore, the theory of<br>the examined process is whether a psychological, sociological, economic, or marketing<br>background is a key criterion in choosing the model.

In<br>other words, it should be clear that a researcher cannot use SEM to derive a description of<br>data such as the data speak for because they do not, e.g., if the<br>covariance matrix contains only variables, one can sort these variables into different causal orders and therefore one can also obtain perfectly fitting saturated<br>structural models, but one can also find many more alternative fitting models. That is why<br>SEM can only be used given pre-specified assumptions about the order of the variables and<br>the specific possible causal effects. What one virtually does with the SEM as an analytical<br>strategy is to test if these assumptions are in agreement with the obtained empirical data.<br>This is the only aspect that a researcher can do with SEM, therefore testing is crucial,<br>which has already been proved in many works (see e.g., Mulaik et al.

On the other hand, we must not forget that the major problem at that<br>time was the power of the tests. Also, the sensitivity of fit indices to specification errors<br>was not known. These issues were discussed by Satorra and Saris in the Psychometrika journal and by Bollen <a name='192' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#192'><font color='#FF0000'>Satorra and Saris independently showed<br>how to calculate the </font></a>power <a name='78' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#78'><font color='#FF0000'>of the likelihood ratio test in covariance structure </font></a>models by<br>using the noncentral Chi-square distribution and <a name='84' href='matsueda.txt.tarka.txt.html#84'><font color='#FF0000'>presented a nearly identical way of<br>approximating the noncentrality parameter.

The issues which were discussed in this article reflect the fundamental problems which<br>researchers may face in the analysis of complex social phenomena and structural equation<br>modeling. Solving these problems, on the one hand, consists in optimization possibilities of<br>theoretical models but, on the other hand, it comes down to a selection of appropriate<br>technical tools in the diagnosis of the examined reality. SEM focuses namely on two<br>sources, i.e., theoretical and technical. The most important sources are the theoretical<br>premises from which we derive both the hypothesis about the measurement and the<br>structural part of the SEM model. The hypotheses specify which parameters can obtain a<br>given value (e.g., zero) and which parameters should be estimated on the basis of empirical<br>data. The second source, in turn, does not result from the theoretical assumption of the<br>examined phenomenon which the model should describe but from strictly technical reasons<br>which, in most cases, focus on a description of parameter quality and model fit to the<br>empirical data or on the description of relationships between measurement errors which<br>occur naturally (or at least do not contradict the theory of the modeled phenomenon).<br>However, in the end the basis for the evaluation and acceptance of the theoretical model, in<br>P. Tarka<br>which we assume certain hypothetical directions, is the positive result of the conducted<br>procedure, which verifies the research hypothesis.<br>The technical issues of SEM became so unrealistic and complex that nobody pays much<br>attention to the theoretical assumptions in SEM anymore, and technology tends to overshadow common sense (Freedman As a result, correct use of SEM is rare. The use<br>of SEM has turned into a kind of fetish or numerical trick whose ultimate aim is to<br>maximize the model fit to the data instead of using carefully differentiated research plans<br>and careful substantive considerations on the grounds of theory. Steiger warned that<br>this tendency has spread even in many published books which introduce SEM as an<br>analytical strategy. Consequently, the authors of these publications are either unaware of<br>the important technical issues of using SEM or they do not want to alienate the potential<br>users of this analytical strategy. Even if the books carefully present the limitations of SEM,<br>the practitioners have a prevailing tendency not to notice or even ignore these limitations.<br>Hence the use of SEM in the social sciences is full of overuse, incorrect interpretation and<br>overinterpretation. The risks are not posed by the SEM model itself but by the lack of awareness of the SEM complexity and limitations.<br>With reference to all of the above-mentioned advantages and disadvantages of SEM<br>models and their application in the context of the social sciences, there are only two<br>possible answers. We can either stop using SEM or work on the improvement of the<br>practices of using this analytical strategy. Calling for an end to the use of SEM has little<br>chance of gaining positive feedback from researchers, as SEM is too valuable and we<br>cannot reject it. It seems that the only correct solution is to work on improving the use of<br>this analytical strategy and obtaining an appropriate reference to it from the perspective of<br>the analyzed data and the considered theories. As a result of these actions, SEM models<br>will lead to better cognitive conclusions and correct results on the basis of the conducted<br>empirical research.<br>Acknowledgements I would like to thank prof.
