Matsueda<br>Structural equation modeling (SEM) has advanced considerably in the social sciences. The<br>direction of advances has varied by the substantive problems faced by individual disciplines. For<br>example, path analysis developed to model inheritance in population genetics, and later to model<br>status attainment in sociology. Factor analysis developed in psychology to explore the structure<br>of intelligence, and simultaneous equation models developed in economics to examine supply<br>and demand.<br>These largely discipline-specific advances came together in the early 1970s to create a<br>multidisciplinary approach to SEM. Later, during the 1980s, responding to criticisms of SEM<br>for failing to meet assumptions implied by maximum likelihood estimation and testing, SEM<br>proponents responded with estimators for data that departed from multivariate normality, and for<br>modeling categorical, ordinal, and limited dependent variables. More recently, advances in SEM<br>have incorporated additional statistical models (growth models, latent class growth models,<br>generalized linear models, and multi-level models), drawn upon artificial intelligence research to<br>attempt to causal structures, and finally, returned to the question of causality with<br>formal methods for specifying assumptions necessary for inferring causality with nonexperimental data.<br>In this chapter, I trace the <a name='117' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#117'><font color='#FF0000'>key advances in the history of structural equation modeling. </font></a>I<br>focus on the early history, and try to convey the excitement of major developments in each<br>discipline, culminating with cross-disciplinary integration in the 1970s.

I conclude with brief treatments of more recent advances to<br>provide introductions to advanced chapters in this volume.<br>EARLY HISTORY: THE DISCIPLINARY ROOTS OF SEM<br>Sewall Path Analysis in Genetics and Biology<br>In Sewall Wright, a young geneticist, published the first application of path analysis,<br>which modeled the bone size of rabbits. After computing all possible partial correlations of his<br>measures, he was still dissatisfied with the results, <a name='33' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#33'><font color='#FF0000'>which remained far from a causal explanation.<br>Consequently, </font></a>Wright <a name='60' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#60'><font color='#FF0000'>developed path analysis to impose a causal structure, with </font></a><a name='205' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#205'><font color='#FF0000'>structural<br>coefficients, on the observed correlations. </font></a>His substantive application decomposed the variation<br>in the size of an individual bone to various hereditary causes (Hill He subsequently<br>applied path analysis to systems of mating, using data on guinea pigs, which laid the basis for<br>much of subsequent population genetics. For example, in modeling the proportion of white color<br>in spotted guinea pigs, Wright decomposed the variance into heredity (h), common<br>environment for the litter (e), and other factors such as developmental noise (d). The path<br>coefficient (h) represents the link between genotype and phenotype, and h2 is the proportion of<br>variance due to heredity, later termed in population genetics. Wright also<br>developed models for systems of mating, showing the consequences of continued inbreeding<br>systems, such as continued brother-sister mating, which results in m where m is the<br>correlation between mates in one generation, and is the correlation between brother and<br>sister of the previous generation (Li He also derived results for intergenerational<br>consequences of assortative mating. Figure reproduces a path diagram of environment and<br>heredity, which Hill calls one of the best known diagrams in biological<br>Wright (1921a, presented the method of path analysis for estimating causal relations<br>among variables based on the correlation matrix of observed variables, emphasizing path<br>coefficients (standardized regression coefficients) but also using (unstandardized coefficients). He invented a graphical method of presenting causal relations<br>using path diagrams, consisting of variable labels connected by arrows for direct effects, doubleheaded arrows for unanalyzed correlations, and the estimated path coefficients listed over singleheaded arrows. From path diagrams, Wright could read off <a name='212' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#212'><font color='#FF0000'>total, direct, and indirect effects, </font></a>and<br>quickly decompose <a name='39' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#39'><font color='#FF0000'>correlations into various causal sources, such as direct effects, indirect<br>effects, common causes, and the like. </font></a>Among the models Wright estimated by path analysis was<br><a name='158' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#158'><font color='#FF0000'>a model of multiple causal indicators, </font></a>or what later became <a name='220' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#220'><font color='#FF0000'>known as the MIMIC model.<br>estimation method was essentially </font></a>the method of moments, which follows <a name='210' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#210'><font color='#FF0000'>the intuitive<br>principle of estimating a population moment </font></a>(or function of moments) <a name='122' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#122'><font color='#FF0000'>using the sample analog<br>moment </font></a>(or function of moments) (Goldberger Although he <a name='8' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#8'><font color='#FF0000'>lacked a principle for<br>reconciling multiple ways of expressing a path coefficient in terms of sample moments in<br>overidentified models, he did check to see if they were close and acknowledged the potential<br>gains in efficiency and reduced standard errors from using full information </font></a>(Goldberger 1972a).<br>While working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Wright worked on corn and<br>hog correlations, developing a complex, highly-overidentified, recursive system of equations<br>containing observed, unobserved, lagged, and un-lagged variables, to describe seasonal data on<br>hog breeding, corn prices, and hog prices. The Department of Agriculture rejected publication of<br>the monograph on the grounds that animal position at the time) no business writing about (Crow research was only published after<br>Henry Wallace read the paper and exploited the influence of his father, then Secretary of<br>Agriculture. Although the recursive model had no explicit demand function, Wright noted in a footnote that a direct negative effect of hog quantity on hog price would be desirable<br>but the of such reciprocal relations between variables requires an extension of the<br>theory of path (see Goldberger 1972a:983).<br>In Sewall father, economist Phillip Wright, published a study of the tariff,<br>which included an infamous applied instrumental variables<br>and path analysis to reciprocal relations between variables. Most scholars presume that the<br>appendix was co-authored with Sewall Wright, although Stock and Trebbi suggest that<br>Phillip may have been sole author.2 Phillip Wright, who had mentioned the identification<br>problem as early as (Wright and presented it in graphical form of supply and<br>demand curves, wrote out what later became known as the reduced form equations:<br>P p1<br>D p2 P S<br>Q q1<br>D q2 Q S<br>where D and S indicate shifts in demand and supply curves after transforming P and Q to trend<br>ratios, and represent standard deviations of variables. Wright noted that the two<br>equations contain four unknowns. They then suggested that if two external variables, A and B,<br>could be found (based on external knowledge of markets) such that A were correlated with D but<br>not S, and B were correlated with S but not D, the principles of path analysis would yield<br>solutions for the four unknowns. Wright had arrived at a more general treatment than offered by<br>Henry Schultz that year or in (Goldberger 1972a:984).

However, when z<br>is causally-prior to x and causally-subsequent to y, z is an intervening variable between x and y.<br>Simon correctly asserted that the determination <a name='180' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#180'><font color='#FF0000'>of whether a partial correlation is or is<br>not spurious </font></a><a name='36' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#36'><font color='#FF0000'>only be reached if a priori assumptions are made that certain other causal<br>relations do not hold among the </font></a>exclusionary restrictions on coefficients and<br>uncorrelated errors in equations.

These papers made important insights into substantive population<br>models, although they tended to gloss over sample-population distinctions, efficient estimation,<br>and formal hypothesis testing.<br>Substantively, Duncan and Hodge had earlier published a four-variable status<br>attainment model on data from Chicago, in which education intervened between the effects<br>of occupation on occupation in and They estimated the models using<br>equation-by-equation multiple regression. Blau and monograph expanded on<br>this model by using national data, distinguishing between hierarchies of occupations and rewards<br>from the process by which individual characteristics sort people into those occupations, and<br>examining whether the American stratification system approximated an open opportunity<br>structure more than a rigid class hierarchy. The study produced an explosion of productive<br>research using path analysis to model status attainment, most notably the Wisconsin status<br>attainment model (e.g., Sewell and Hauser Factor Analysis in Psychology<br>In psychology, interest in SEM originated in factor analysis, which is a statistical method for<br>analyzing a correlation or covariance matrix of observed variables to identify a small number of<br>factors, components, or latent variables, that contain the essential information in the original<br>variables.

We can express the model in<br>matrix form:<br>y1 y2 y3 y4 y The term, dog originated with Beverly Duncan, who noted that the path diagram (see Figure resembled a walking dog, in which here depicted the face and tail (Hauser, personal communication).<br>It then follows that the covariance structure model is:<br>yy where yy E y y is the (population) covariance matrix of observable indicators, is a matrix<br>of loadings, is a matrix of regression coefficients among latent variables, E is<br>the covariance matrix of structural disturbances, and E is a covariance matrix of<br>measurement errors (diagonal in this example). This model is overidentified with one degree of<br>freedom moments and parameters). The overidentifying restriction implies that there is<br>more than one way of computing parameters in terms of moments and there is a testable<br>overidentifying restriction in the data. This can be seen by computing moments in terms of<br>parameters (normal equations) and then solving for parameters in terms of moments. For<br>example,<br>By cross-multiplying the second two terms and rearranging, we obtain the identical tetraddifference restriction as found by Spearman and given above in equation but in<br>unstandardized form: Because can be satisfied by many different models, a<br>traditional structural equation approach tests a specific nested parameterization of the restriction,<br>rather than testing the tetrad-difference constraint on moments directly.<br>In estimating overidentified models, the question becomes which moment estimator(s)<br>should be used. We can see this by replacing the population moments in with their sample<br>counterparts, and noting we have two moment estimators for In overidentified fully-<br>recursive models, the OLS estimator is unbiased and efficient; therefore, using the moment<br>estimator corresponding to OLS (giving it a weight of one) and ignoring other instrumental<br>variable moment estimators (giving them a weight of zero), is optimal. In the general case,<br>however, one would not want to use only one estimator or a simple unweighted average, but<br>instead weight the moments inversely to their sampling variability. Hauser and Goldberger<br>show that this is precisely what maximum likelihood does when minimizing the fit<br>function in equation in equation above. We can illustrate this point by noting that<br>minimizing equation is asymptotically equivalent to minimizing a quadratic form (Anderson<br>Browne FGLS s W s where s is a vector of non-redundant elements from the sample covariance matrix S, is the<br>corresponding vector of elements of the parametric structure of the covariance matrix makes s a discrepancy vector to be W is a weight matrix consisting <a name='156' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#156'><font color='#FF0000'>of<br>the covariance matrix of </font></a>the sample moments. Under normality, the latter consists of products of<br>second-order moments about the mean. Thus, the parameters in are expressed as a function<br>of sample moments s, each of which is weighted inverse to its sampling variability by W. The<br>estimator in equation termed GLS by Browne has been applied to econometric<br>models by Hansen who terms it the generalized method of moments.<br>The second model analyzed by Hauser and Goldberger the MIMIC model, is<br>presented in a simple four-variable three-equation form in Figure This model has nine<br>parameters, ten observable moments, and therefore, one overidentifying restriction. In matrix<br>form, the model is:<br>y1 y2 y x1 x2 x and the covariance structure is:<br>yy xy where xy E x y contains the covariances between x and y, yy E y y the covariances<br>among the ys, xx E x (covariances among xs are unconstrained), E the<br>covariance matrix of measurement errors in y (assumed diagonal here), and E the<br>covariance matrix of the structural disturbance(s). Let us fix to normalize the latent<br>variable and give it a metric; one could also normalize by fixing to a constant.<br>Using path analysis, we can compute moments in terms of parameters, solve for the<br>parameters, and obtain two ways of expressing parameters in terms of moments. For example,<br>y x y x y x y x Replacing the population moments with their sample counterparts gives us two sample moment<br>estimators of Also, if we cross-multiply the right two terms in we get a single tetraddifference overidentifying restriction, y2 x2 y2 y1x2 Note that this is the same restriction<br>on observable moments we found for the walking dog model above (if we denote all variables as<br>ys), which illustrates an important difficulty for structural equation models: overidentifying<br>restrictions can be satisfied by substantively different models. In general, maximum likelihood<br>will provide consistent and asymptotically efficient estimates by weighting sample moments<br>inverse to their sampling variability, resulting in optimal weights for multiple moment<br>estimators. Again, minimizing the likelihood function will provide a likelihood ratio test of<br>overidentifying restrictions.<br>Hauser and Goldberger also use econometric methods to study identification and<br>estimation. By substituting into in we obtain the reduced form:<br>y1 x1 y2 x2 y x<br>where and The reduced form can always be efficiently estimated using OLS. The estimation issue arises<br>because there are two ways of expressing structural parameters in terms of reduced-form<br>parameters:<br>This also implies a proportionality constraint on reduced form parameters, providing a test of the<br>MIMIC specification. Maximum likelihood weights the reduced form parameter estimates pq<br>inverse to their sampling variability to obtain asymptotically efficient estimates (Hauser and<br>Goldberger In this example, there is one degree of freedom and the single constraint can<br>be expressed in terms of observed moments or reduced-form parameters. Generally, in more<br>complex models, both kinds of restrictions exist, and maximum likelihood will use both forms of<br>restrictions in estimating parameters.14 JÃ¶reskog and Goldberger later expanded on<br><a name='226' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#226'><font color='#FF0000'>maximum likelihood estimation of the </font></a>MIMIC model and Goldberger discussed<br>estimation <a name='9' href='tarka.txt.matsueda.txt.html#9'><font color='#FF0000'>in overidentified models with latent variables </font></a>and simultaneity.

However, it was<br>version and software package that came to dominate the field. The LISREL model<br>incorporates factor analysis, simultaneous equation models, and path analysis (as discussed<br>above) into a general covariance structure model (e.g., JÃ¶reskog and SÃ¶rbom yy<br>xy<br>yx y xx x y x JÃ¶reskog showed that maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by minimizing the<br>following fit function and solving for parameters:<br>FML log log S tr S p q<br>Where S is the sample estimate of the population covariance matrix, and p and q are constants<br>reflecting the number of observed ys and xs respectively.
